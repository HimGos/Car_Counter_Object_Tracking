# Car_Counter_Object_Tracking
This program uses Yolov8 and OpenCV to count the number of cars on highway.
Since this model is tracking the cars and counting them on a particular point on video, it works for specific video on a particular highway. Using it on other traffic videos will give incorrect result. 

Run Requirements.txt file AND install pytorch-gpu version addionally from here - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

Run car_counter.py file in car_counter folder.
